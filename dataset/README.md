# Dataset

This library converts random dataset into standard format for training in this project.

###  Assumptions:

* We assume that each training sample should contains at least:
    
    * An Image
    * A label with information of all objects coordinates in that image.
    
* There might be more information (difficulty, segmentation mask) in the label. However, it is out of the scope of this object
